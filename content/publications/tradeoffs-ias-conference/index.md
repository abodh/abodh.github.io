abstract: This paper introduces a probabilistic framework to quantify community vulnerability towards power losses due to extreme weather events. To analyze the impact of weather events on the power grid, the wind fields of historical hurricanes from 2000–2018 on the Texas coast are modeled using their available parameters, and probabilistic storm surge scenarios are constructed utilizing the hurricane characteristics. The vulnerability of hurricanes and storm surges is evaluated on a 2000bus synthetic power grid model on the geographical footprint of Texas. The load losses, obtained via branch and substation outages, are then geographically represented at the county level and integrated with the publicly available Social Vulnerability Index to evaluate the Integrated Community Vulnerability Index (ICVI), which reflects the impacts of these extreme weather events on the socioeconomic and community power systems. The analysis concludes that the compounded impact of power outages due to extreme weather events can amplify the vulnerability of affected communities. Such analysis can help the system planners and operators make an informed decision.
