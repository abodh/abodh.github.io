abstract: This paper develops a spatiotemporal probabilistic impact assessment framework to analyze and quantify the compounding effect of hurricanes and storm surges on the bulk power grid. The probabilistic synthetic hurricane tracks are generated using historical hurricane data, and storm surge scenarios are generated based on observed hurricane parameters. The system losses are modeled using a loss metric that quantifies the total load loss. The overall simulation is performed on the synthetic Texas 2000-bus system mapped on the geographical footprint of Texas. The results show that power substation inundation due to storm surge creates additional load losses as the hurricane traverses inland.
